# Programming assignment in C: Linked-List Xtensions

Second programming assignment for learning C as a second programming language. 

## Requirements
1. C language.
   The assignment consists of writing a working program in the C programming language.
   
2. Linked list.
   Use your code from the [C pointer exercises assignment](https://github.com/ivogeorg/c-pointer-exercises.git) as a basis. It's assumed that you have a linked list of integers, that is, the data in each node is a single `int`. Then, choose **ONE** of the following extensions (difficulty level in square brackets):
   - [2] Doubly-linked list of integers with insert function 

     Convert the singly-linked list into a doubly-linked list. The elements of a doubly-linked list are connected in both directions, so it can be traversed from the `head` toward the `tail` and from the `tail` toward the `head`. Modify the `list_insert` function to match.

   - [2] Delete for singly-linked list of integers
   
     Extend your singly-linked `int` list with a `list_delete` function, which deletes the first node which matches the data argument.

   - [3] Structure data base type with comparison function for structure type
   
     Create a singly- or doubly-linked list with a `struct` data type. Provide as an argument a `node_compare` function that works for this `struct` type the way the numerical comparison operators (`<`, `<=`, `>=`, `>`, `==`, and `!=`) work for numeric primitive types. Provide a `list_insert` function that preserves the order of the list.
     
   - [4] Structure of strings data base type with comparison function
   
     Create a singly- or doubly-linked list with a `struct` data type. The `struct` should contain *C-style strings*. Provide as an argument a `node_compare` function that works for this `struct` type the way the numerical comparison operators (`<`, `<=`, `>=`, `>`, `==`, and `!=`) work for numeric primitive types. Provide a `list_insert` function that preserves the order of the list.

3. Github.
   1. Fork this repository.
   2. Clone the remote to your local development environment.
   3. Implement and ensure your program is working correctly.
   4. Commit your changes.
   5. Push your commits to the remote, to submit your assignment.
   
4. Project description.
   You need to state which extension you picked and describe your implementation, in the provided section below.
   
   
## Project description

### Extension

I chose the doubly linked list with insert function. I also added a delete function.

### Implementation notes

I used the code from the last project as a basis, but did some research and it seemed like I would need to use some double pointers to account for the 2-way nature of the list.
Numbers can be added to the front, back, and inserted after a selected node. Selected nodes can also be deleted.
